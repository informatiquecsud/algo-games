# Algorithmic games

This project provides a framework for designing card games aiming at developing
algorithmic thinking, especially developing algorithms over lists.

This project uses the `justpy` framework to build interactive widgets and app
accessible trough the browser over the Web but without any Javascript code.
Everything is written in pure Python.

## Installation

More instructions are coming.

## TODO

- [ ] Add a `max_visible` property to `CardList`. If an additional card is
  turned, the first turned amongst those visible should be turned back and
  become invisible. Tihs allows to simulate the fact that the computer is only
  able to see an limited amount of cards simultaneously (typically 2).
